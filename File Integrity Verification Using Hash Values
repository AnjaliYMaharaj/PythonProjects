# 🛡️ File Integrity Verification Using Hash Values

## 📋 Project Overview
In this lab, I acted as a Security Analyst to verify file integrity using cryptographic hashing. I used Linux commands to generate SHA-256 hashes for two similar files and compared them to check for any differences.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand how hash functions work
- Generate hash values using `sha256sum`
- Compare outputs using `cat` and `cmp` commands

---

## 🧪 Scenario
Given two files, `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`, which appear visually identical, I needed to verify if they are truly the same or if any hidden differences exist.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- `sha256sum` – Generate SHA-256 hash values  
- `cat` – Display file contents  
- `cmp` – Byte-by-byte file comparison  
- Bash Shell (Linux)

## 🔧 Lab Tasks

### Task 1: Generate Hashes
```bash
cat file1.txt
cat file2.txt
sha256sum file1.txt
sha256sum file2.txt

sha256sum file1.txt >> file1hash
sha256sum file2.txt >> file2hash
cat file1hash
cat file2hash
cmp file1hash file2hash
