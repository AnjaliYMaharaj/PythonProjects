# Personal Project: Accessing News API with Python

This project is my journey to explore APIs using Python. I decided to start with the News API to fetch the latest news articles programmatically. 

To follow along or run the code yourself, you'll need to get a free API key from News API. Hereâ€™s how I did it:

## How to Get Your News API Key

1. Go to [https://newsapi.org/](https://newsapi.org/)

2. Click the **Get API Key** button at the top right corner of the homepage.

3. Fill out the registration form with your details and submit it.

4. Once registered, the website will show you your unique **API key**.

> **Note:** This key is essential for authenticating requests to the News API in Python scripts.

## Next Steps

After obtaining the API key, I used it in my Python code to fetch and display news articles. This was a great introduction to working with REST APIs and handling JSON data in Python.

Feel free to clone this repo and try it yourself. Just remember to replace the API key in the code with your own!
